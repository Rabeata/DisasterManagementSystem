# Disaster Management System

After the Gaza war and the destruction left by the Israeli occupation, even cutting off the medical and rescue supplies and cutting off the communication lines with the emergency, an idea was created to work on a project to manage the rescue operations.

The idea is based on a mobile application that is downloaded to peopleâ€™s devices, and a server to manage the operations in real-time that is installed on a server in one of the local community institutions such as the municipality or emergency committee. If there is a danger of having a disconnection from the internet, the main task for the institutions is deploying Wi-Fi devices at the level of the town with devices to maintain the connection of electricity such as generators. In case the internet or calls are cut off, communication can be made with the rescue parties through the Wi-Fi that is deployed by the local community authorities and connect the status of the residents first-hand.
